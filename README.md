# [Craigslist-Cars-FlaskAPI](https://vehicle-price-estimator.herokuapp.com/)
This repository hosts a productionized vehicle price predictor model which I developed based on ~37,000 vehicle listings in southern British Columbia. The reposity for the full project is [here](https://github.com/asylve/Craiglist-Cars-Study). 

You can try out the model [here](https://vehicle-price-estimator.herokuapp.com/). Copy in a Craigslist vehicle listing to get the estimated market value.
